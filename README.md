**Attack Chain:** Brute Force → Credential Compromise → Web Shell Upload → Data Exfiltration

## 📊 What's Inside
- **Incident Report** - Complete narrative with timeline, evidence, and actions
- **Splunk Detection Queries** - Real SPL for threat detection
- **Dashboard Configurations** - SOC monitoring visualizations
- **Screenshots** - Actual Splunk interface during investigation
- **Lessons Learned** - Security recommendations and gaps

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **SIEM Operations:** Splunk query development, dashboard creation, alert tuning
- **Incident Response:** Timeline analysis, evidence collection, containment procedures
- **Threat Hunting:** Proactive detection using log correlation
- **Reporting:** Executive and technical documentation
